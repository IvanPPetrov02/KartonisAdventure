Fiki: Hi dad, I heard what happened last night. Are you alright?
Kartoni: Well, as well as a hungover man can be...
Fiki: I came here as soon as possible to check up on you.
Kartoni: Well, thanks for caring, but I really gotta go and find my stuff since I don't want to miss my next concert.
Fiki: Ah, right about that. I managed to find your bootsâ€”they were at the nightclub you sung at last night.
Kartoni: Oh, really? Then more of my stuff should be there.
Fiki: I hope so. I don't have much time, but I wish you good luck on getting there.

Fiki: Dad, I wish I could stay and help, but I haven't gotten my workout of the day yet, and I have my priorities set right. You should be more responsible after all.
Kartoni: Okay... I see your point. Take care.
